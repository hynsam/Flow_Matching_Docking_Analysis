# Flow_Matching_Docking_Analysis

This contains a slightly earlier version of the structural analysis code employed for the paper:

D. A. Sharon*, Y. Huang*, M. J. Oyewole, S. Mustafa, “How to Go with the Flow: An Analysis of Flow Matching Molecular Docking Performance with Priors of Varying Information Content”, 12th International Conference on Learning Representations Generative and Experimental Perspectives for Biomolecular Design Workshop paper, 2024. *Equal contribution.
